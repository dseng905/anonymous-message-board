# Anonymous Message Board
## Overview
The anonymous message board is a message board that allows users to create threads and reply to them without a user profile. The board is divided into sub-boards that can access through the board lists or the search bar on the navigation bar on the right of the screen. Each thread and reply are created with a password assigned by the user so that the user can delete them at anytime. Users can also report threads and replies that may be considered inappropriate. 

The message board is powered by React with React-router which allows seamless navigation and quick creations of replies and threads without having to refresh the browser. The server is handled with Node.js with Express.js to handle requests to create, delete, and retrieve data from a MongoDB database.
